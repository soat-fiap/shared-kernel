# bmb shared-kernel

This repository contains common elements that are shared between all BMB microservices ecosystem.

There's some remaining code, that could have been placed on its individual repo such as Product entity. Since there's no such individual microservice, I've decided to keep it isolated here to simplify the migration whenever I decide to create a new microservice.

It also has a set of JWT configuration helper classes.
